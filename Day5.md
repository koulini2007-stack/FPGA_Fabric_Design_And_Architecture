# Constraints File

An **SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints)** file was used to define the timing requirements for the RVMYTH design.

## Constraint File

```tcl id="szon5n"
create_clock -period 200 clk
set_input_delay -clock clk -max 0 [get_ports {*}]
set_output_delay -clock clk -max 0 [get_ports {*}]
```

## Defined Constraints

* Clock Period
* Input Delay Constraints
* Output Delay Constraints

These constraints guide the timing analysis engine during placement, routing, and timing verification.
