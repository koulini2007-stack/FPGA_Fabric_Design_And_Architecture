# FPGA_Fabric_Design_And_Architecture
This repository presents a comprehensive study of FPGA design methodologies, implementation workflows, architectural exploration, and performance evaluation carried out during the FPGA Fabric Design and Architecture workshop.

The project covers the end-to-end FPGA development process, beginning with RTL design and progressing through synthesis, placement, routing, timing closure, resource utilization analysis, power estimation, and post-implementation validation. In addition, it explores custom FPGA architecture generation and fabric design using modern open-source CAD frameworks.

Key areas of focus include:
* FPGA design flow and architecture fundamentals
* RTL development and implementation
* Placement and routing optimization
* Timing and performance analysis
* Resource utilization and power evaluation

The repository documents the complete hands-on flow using:

* VTR (Verilog-to-Routing)
* VPR (Versatile Place and Route)
* OpenFPGA
* Vivado
* SOFA FPGA Architecture Framework
* RVMYTH RISC-V Processor Core
